# mywebsite

## Description
A remote repository for [my website](https:www.arisbarlos.com),
The code can be a template for even better portfolio sites in the future and is free for everybody to test and re-develop any way he likes.

### Languages/ Dependencies
I used **React** for the rendering of the page, and **plain Javascript** for the animations in Canvas.
I also used **Babel** because I used ES6 syntax.

## File System
The file system is really simple.

     File     |  Description  
     :--:     |     :---:     
_index.html_  | Contains HTML that is used for the atomic rendering of every Component
_external-css.css_ | Contains every CSS Rule I need to create. It is in the same way as the document flow of index.html. e.g Cube Section is styled before Welcome Section and that is the way they appear in the document too.
