# mywebsite

## Description
A remote repository for [my website](https://www.arisbarlos.com). <br/>
The code can be a template for even better portfolio sites in the future and <br/> is free for everybody to test and re-develop any way he likes.

### Languages/ Dependencies
I used **React** for the rendering of the page and **plain Javascript** for the animations in Canvas.<br />
I also used **Babel**  to transform ES6 JavaScript syntax to ES5.

<br/>
<br/>

## File System
The file system is really simple.

File  | Description  
:---: | :---:     
_index.html_  | Contains HTML that is used for the atomic rendering of every Component
_external-css.css_ | Contains all the CSS Rules I created.
arisbarloscom.xml | The submitted sitemap to google for my website.
skills Folder | Contains SVG images that are used in my document. It's an image folder.
photos folder | General photos that are used in my website
js Folder | Contains every js file I created.

<br/>

:---: | :---:     
_data.js_  | Contains the content I render to the visitor.

The rest of the files inside thr individual folders are the components that are used in the project.
