## Description
A remote repository for [my website](https://www.arisbarlos.com),
The code can be a template for even better portfolio sites in the future and is free for everybody to test and re-develop any way he likes.

### Languages/ Dependencies
I used **React** and for the rendering of the page, and **plain Javascript** for the animations in Canvas.
I also used **Babel** because I used ES6 syntax.
